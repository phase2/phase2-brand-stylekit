Partially transparent overlays are a major element of the Phase2 brand. They reflect our open and transparent character, and they offer opportunities to share images of Phase2 in action as backgrounds to other pieces of content (see our photography guidelines for more information on photo selection). Remember to keep colors at 85% opacity, minimum to preserve the integrity of the color.

_Partial or full color transparencies over monochromatic or full color photos is a great opportunity for text placement on top of color blocks_
