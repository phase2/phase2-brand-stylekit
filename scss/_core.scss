// This file is what is imported by downstream dependencies and should not export anything that would create CSS.
// So basically we export out variables, mixins, and functions.
// If this file creates CSS then `npm test` fails, which is ran by the Travis CI.

// We can't use globbing in here because downstream projects that rely on this might not have sass globbing installed
// and even if they did, we can't be sure it'd be configured correctly to globb-ify this file. We can use globbing in
// the `style.scss` file that is responsible for styling the Pattern Lab instance though.
